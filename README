crackpkcs12 is a multithreaded program to crack PKCS12 files using a dictionary attack and/or a brute force attack

User can choose the number of threads. By default, every CPU of the machine is used.

No dictionary file is provided.

To compile it you have to install openssl development library (libssl-dev [Debian and Ubuntu] or openssl-devel [Fedora]).

To use it you have to install openssl library.

Usage:

crackpkcs12 { -d <dictionary_file> |  -b <max_psw_length> [ -c <base_char_sets> ] } [ -t <num_of_threads> ] [ -v ] [ -s <message_interval> ] <file_to_crack>

-b <max_password_length> Use brute force attack and specify maximum length of password

-c <base_char_sets>      Specify characters sets (one or more than one) and order to conform passwords
                         a = letters (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)
                         A = capital letters (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ)
                         n = digits (0123456789)
                         s = special characters (!\"#$%%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~)
                         x = all previous sets\n\n"

-d <dictionary_file>     Use dictionary attack and specify dictionary file path

-t <number_of_threads>   Specify number of threads (by default number of CPU's)

-v                       Verbose mode

-s <message_inteval>     Number of attemps between messages (implied -v) (default 100000)
